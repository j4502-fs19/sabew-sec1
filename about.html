    <h1 id ="about">About</h1>
    <p>The Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing was formed in 1964 to promote superior coverage of business and economic events and issues. Originally called the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, SABEW changed its name in 2018 as part of a broader effort to embrace a global focus on business journalism.</p>
    <p>Less than a half century ago the very idea that business news would ever emerge from behind the classified advertisement section would have been preposterous. But in the late 1950s, business news began to make the climb from obscurity.</p>
    <p>The movement began when the late R.K.T. (Kit) Larson, former associate editor of the <i>Virginian-Pilot</i> and <i>Ledger-Star</i> in Norfolk, Va., began talking with Charles C. Abbott of the University of Virginia about “the generally poor reporting of business news in the country’s press.”</p>
    <p>Larson organized several small seminars, and in 1961 put together a three-day session that attracted 60 business editors and writers. The success of that seminar resulted in another in 1963.</p>
    <p>A permanent organization took shape in 1964 when SABEW held its first meeting in New York City. In 1984, the Society took a major step by voting to place its offices at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. In 2009, the Board of Governors voted to move the Society’s headquarters to Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication in downtown Phoenix, where it was established in September of that year.</p>
    <p>Today, its more than 3,400 members are from North America and several countries. In 1990, SABEW began offering institutional memberships, and now entire business staffs at major newspapers, business journals, business weeklies, wire services, online publications and broadcast outlets are members.</p>
    <p>As part of its educational mission, SABEW sponsors an annual convention and specialized reporting conference. It also confers business journalism awards for excellence in business journalism, as well as honors individuals who have made long-standing contributions to business journalism.</p>
    <p>In an era when business news routinely tops the front pages, leads the network news and results in the creation of new magazines, it seems hard to imagine a time when things were different. To make sure that business journalism keeps its new-found-popularity, SABEW has worked closely with the University of Missouri to raise $1.1 million to endow a chair for business journalism education.</p>

    <h1 id = "mission">Mission</h1>
      <p>Members of SABEW band together in the individual and collective pursuit of the highest standards of economic journalism. The organization recognizes that economic freedom is inextricably linked to political freedom and that an informed citizenry can ensure these freedoms are sustained. It is SABEW’s mission as an independent, non-profit organization to encourage comprehensive reporting of economic events without fear or favoritism and to increase members’ skills and knowledge through continuous education.</p>
      <p>SABEW recently has become more focused on press freedom. To that end, it has issued statements and created events and training highlighting the importance of journalism, including the principle that fact-based reporting is necessary for the health of robust democracies. SABEW advocates for full access to financial and economic data, including information collected and distributed by governments.</p>
      <p>SABEW also holds an annual Best in Business awards competition, recognizing outstanding journalism conducted in the U.S. and abroad among professionals and students.</p>

    <p><b>Statement of Purpose</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>As business and financial journalists, we recognize we are guardians of the public trust and must do nothing to abuse this obligation. It is not enough that we act with honest intent; as journalists, we must conduct our professional lives in a manner that avoids even the suggestion of personal gain, or any misuse of the power of the media. It is with this acknowledgment that we offer these guidelines for those who work in business and financial journalism.</li>
    <li>SABEW also holds an annual Best in Business awards competition, recognizing outstanding journalism conducted in the U.S. and abroad among professionals and students.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Personal Investments and Relationships</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Avoid any practice that might compromise or appear to compromise objectivity or fairness.</li>
    <li>Never let personal investments influence content. Disclose investment positions to your superior and/or directly to the public.</li>
    <li>Disclose to your superiors and/or directly to the public any personal or family relationships that might pose conflicts of interest.</li>
    <li>Avoid active trading and other short-term profit-seeking opportunities, as such activities are not compatible with the independent role of the business journalist.</li>
    <li>Do not take advantage of inside information for personal gain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Sources</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Insure confidentiality of information during the reporting process, and make every effort to keep information from finding its way to those who might use it for gain before it is disseminated to the public.</li>
    <li>Do not alter information, delay or withhold publication or make concessions relating to news content to any source or subject of the story.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Gifts and Favors</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>In the course of professional activity, accept no gift or special treatment worth more than token value.</li>
    <li>Accept no out-of-town travel paid for, in whole or in part, by outside sources.</li>
    <li>Carefully examine offers of freelance work or speech honoraria to assure such offers are not attempts to influence content.</li>
    <li>Disclose to a supervisor any offer of future employment or outside income that springs from the journalist’s professional activities or contacts.</li>
    <li>Accept food or refreshments of ordinary value only if absolutely necessary, and only during the normal course of business.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Editorial Integrity</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Publishers, owners and newsroom managers should establish policies and guidelines to protect the integrity of business news coverage.</li>
    <li>Material produced by editorial staff should be used only in sections, programming or pages controlled by editorial departments.</li>
    <li>Content, sections or programming controlled by advertising departments should be distinctly different from news content in typeface, layout and design. Advertising content should be identified as such.</li>
    <li>Promising a story in exchange for advertising or other considerations is unethical.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Using Outside Material</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Using articles or columns from non-journalists is potentially deceptive and poses inherent conflicts of interest. This does not apply to content that is clearly labeled opinion or viewpoint, or to submissions identified as coming directly from the public, such as citizen blogs or letters to the editor.</li>
    <li>Freelance submissions should be accepted only from those who abide by the same ethical policies as staff members.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Technology</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>In using Twitter, Facebook and other social media, journalists should avoid comments, photographs, video and other activities, whether for professional or personal purposes that would call into question their integrity.</li>
    <li>The business journalist should encourage fellow journalists to abide by these standards and principles.</li>
    </ul>
